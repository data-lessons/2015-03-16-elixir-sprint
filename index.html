<h2>Hackathon Information</h2>
<p>
  This event aims at developing training materials in life sciences to be used in
  <a href="http://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a> workshops and
  other training that is using a similar teaching model. Data Carpentry workshops are aimed at
  researchers in the life sciences at all career stages. The workshops are designed to teach basic concepts, skills
  and tools for working more effectively with data. Data Carpentry workshops are an example-driven two-day workshops
  during which short tutorials alternate with hands-on practical exercises, and participants are encouraged
  both to help one another, and to try applying what they have learned to their own research problems during
  and between sessions. See the  <a href="http://datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry website</a> for more info. <br/></p>


<h2> Venue</h2>
<div>
  Please note the exact location: <br/>
  CSC,   Life Science Center Keilaniemi, Keilaranta 14, Espoo <br/>
  We will be using the rooms: the CSC teaching room on the ground floor (room 1372), the adjacent lobby area and meeting room.
</div>



<h2>Participation</h2>
<p>This hackathon is primarily aimed at the ELIXIR project members. We invite all domain experts who are interested in and may already provide
  training in data handling; and who are willing to share their materials with a wider community. Participants with experience in running Data and
  Software Carpentry workshops are particularily encouraged to join. The <a href="#guidelines">contribution guidelines</a> provide more information
  on the work planned for the hackathon. <br/>
  The local ELIXIR Node Data and Software Coordinators will be contacting the potential participants directly but if you are interested in joining
  the event please contact <a href="mailto:aleksandra.pawlik@manchester.ac.uk">Aleksandra Pawlik</a>.</p>

<h3>Suggested ideas and Scope of the hackathon</h3>

  There are many ways in which the participants can contribute to the
  development of new and the improvement of existing training materials for life
  sciences in Data Carpentry.  We will use GitHub to organize ideas and store
  the material being developed during the workshop.  If you don't already have
  one, please create a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> account. It's
  free and only takes a few seconds. If you are not familiar with Git, you'll be
  able to use
  the <a href="https://github.com/data-lessons/2015-03-16-elixir-sprint/wiki">wiki
  interface</a> that GitHub provides.




    <ul> Improve the current material:
      <li>make sure that <a href="https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry">current lessons</a>
	  have learning objectives and challenges associated with them so they
	  conform to the <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/lesson-template/">Software Carpentry lesson template</a>;</li>
      <li>take advantage of new measurements in
	<a href="https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry/tree/master/data/biology">mammal dataset</a>
	to include more plotting;</li>
      <li>refactor current <a href="https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry/tree/master/lessons/R">R lesson</a>
	to differentiate a little more from
	<a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-inflammation">the content included in Software Carpentry</a>.</li>
    </ul>


  <ul> Develop new material:
    <li> check <a href="https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry/issues">
	this list of proposed tasks / issues</a>
      and select the ones you are keen to work on.</li>
    <li> translate current lessons to use other datasets; these datasets should be publicly available
      (if they are going to be included in the Data Carpentry curriculum);
      it might worth developing a lesson around <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/data/">the Gapminder
	dataset</a> that is of general interest (for multidisciplinary workshop audiences).</li>
    <li> develop a new R lesson that uses <a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html">
	<em>dplyr</em></a>
      rather than base R for data manipulation.</li>
  </ul>



   <ul>
    <li> If you have your own datasets which you already use for teaching and you would be keen to share, we will provide detailed
      guidelines on how to do that during the Hackathon. Good datasets which are rich enough for teaching but not overwhelmingly
      large and freely available are  difficult to get.
    </li>
    <li> You may also chose to develop training materials for a particular tool
      used in data manipulation following the Data Carpentry model. We will
      provide a lesson template to help you structure the material. </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Hackathon organization & preparation</h2>
<p>
  By nature, Hackathons are relatively unstructured events.
  Participants will self-organize in teams centered around shared interests.
  At the beginning of the first day, participants will be encouraged to present (in 5 minutes or less) their idea(s) for projects they would like to work on.
  Depending on interests and ideas that overlap or intersect, teams will forms to work on some of these selected ideas.
  At the beginning of the second day, a representative of each team will report on their project.
  Teams are fluid. If someone wants to switch projects during the hackathon (e.g., because their expertise is needed for a short period of time) it's perfectly acceptable.
</p>
<p>
  To best prepare for the hackathon, it is a good idea to come with at least an idea of the kind of project you would like to work on.
  By <a href="https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry/issues/new">opening an issue</a> in the Data Carpentry Repository,
  you will let other people know of your ideas before the meeting. This will facilitate collaborations during the hackathon.
  Feel free to let people know that you are interested to work with them on a topic they proposed, or offer suggestions to their ideas.
  Be prepared to provide a 5 minute pitch of your idea during the first day of the hackathon.
